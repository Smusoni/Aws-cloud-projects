# Project 2: AWS Networking & SSH Troubleshooting

## Goal
Understand AWS networking layers and troubleshoot SSH connectivity issues.

## AWS Services & Concepts
- VPC
- Subnets
- Route Tables
- NACLs
- Security Groups
- EC2
- AWS CloudShell

## What I Did
- Debugged SSH timeouts
- Reviewed subnet placement and routing paths
- Checked security groups vs NACL rules
- Used CloudShell to validate access
- Corrected network rules to restore connectivity

## Key Learnings
- Security Groups are stateful, NACLs are stateless
- Multiple layers must allow traffic
- Routing determines public accessibility

## Proof
